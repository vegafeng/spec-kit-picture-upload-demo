# My Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. High Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST adhere to industry best practices and coding standards. Code quality is measured through static analysis, peer review, and maintainability metrics. Every class, method, and package MUST have clear purpose and follow SOLID principles. No code is merged without passing quality gates.

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces technical debt, improves maintainability, and ensures long-term project sustainability.

### II. Comprehensive Test Coverage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test coverage MUST exceed 90% for all production code. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. All critical paths and edge cases MUST be covered. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged for new features.

**Rationale**: High test coverage ensures code reliability, enables confident refactoring, and reduces production bugs.

### III. Performance Stability
Performance MUST be consistent and predictable. All features MUST include performance benchmarks and monitoring. Performance regressions are treated as bugs and MUST be addressed before release. Load testing is mandatory for user-facing features.

**Rationale**: Stable performance ensures good user experience and system reliability under varying loads.

### IV. Documentation-First Development
Every feature MUST be documented before implementation. This includes API documentation, architectural decisions, and user guides. Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming and comprehensive comments for complex logic.

**Rationale**: Documentation ensures knowledge transfer, reduces onboarding time, and facilitates maintenance.

### V. Continuous Integration & Quality Gates
All code changes MUST pass automated quality gates including: static analysis, security scans, test execution, and performance benchmarks. No manual bypassing of quality gates is permitted.

**Rationale**: Automated quality gates ensure consistent standards and prevent human error in quality assurance.

## Quality Standards

**Code Quality Metrics**:
- Cyclomatic complexity: ≤10 per method
- Code duplication: <3%
- Technical debt ratio: <5%
- Security vulnerabilities: 0 high/critical

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit test coverage: ≥90%
- Integration test coverage: ≥80%
- Mutation testing score: ≥75%
- Test execution time: <5 minutes for full suite

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- API response time: <200ms p95
- Memory usage growth: <1% per hour under load
- CPU utilization: <70% under normal load
- Database query performance: <100ms p95

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Process**:
- All changes require peer review by at least 2 team members
- Reviewers MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Automated quality checks MUST pass before review
- Performance impact MUST be assessed for user-facing changes

**Release Process**:
- All quality gates MUST pass
- Performance regression testing MUST be completed
- Security scan MUST show no new vulnerabilities
- Documentation MUST be updated for user-facing changes

**Branch Strategy**:
- Feature branches for all development
- Main branch always deployment-ready
- No direct commits to main branch
- Squash merging with descriptive commit messages

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members MUST understand and follow these principles. Violations MUST be addressed immediately through coaching or process improvement.

**Amendment Process**:
- Amendments require unanimous team agreement
- All changes MUST be documented with rationale
- Impact assessment MUST be conducted for dependent processes
- Migration plan MUST be provided for breaking changes

**Compliance Review**:
- Weekly constitution compliance review in team meetings
- Quarterly deep-dive assessment of metrics and adherence
- Annual constitution review and potential updates

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-15 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-15
