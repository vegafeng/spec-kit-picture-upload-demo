# Specification Quality Checklist: Photo Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Clarifications Resolved**: All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved:
  - FR-010: Maximum file size set to 50MB (balances quality and performance)
  - FR-011: Duplicate detection using file hash comparison (most accurate method)
  - FR-012: Batch delete allows multiple selection within date groups (safe but convenient)
- **Technology Direction**: React frontend, Node.js backend, local image storage
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan`
