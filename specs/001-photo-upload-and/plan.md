# Implementation Plan: Photo Management System

**Branch**: `001-photo-upload-and` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-photo-upload-and/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Users can upload and organize photos with automatic date grouping and drag-and-drop sorting capabilities. Technical approach uses React frontend with Node.js backend, implementing file upload with metadata extraction, local storage management, and intuitive user interface for photo organization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES2022, Node.js 18+, React 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Express.js, Multer (file upload), ExifReader (metadata), Sharp (image processing)  
**Storage**: Local file system with organized directory structure  
**Testing**: Jest (unit tests), React Testing Library (component tests), Supertest (API tests)  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend API)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s photo upload for 10MB files, <100ms thumbnail generation, 60fps drag animations  
**Constraints**: <200ms API response time p95, <512MB memory per 1000 photos, 50MB max file size  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, ~10,000 photos capacity, responsive design for desktop/tablet

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application structure with separate backend and frontend directories. Backend handles file upload, metadata extraction, and storage management. Frontend provides React-based UI for photo upload and organization. This separation allows independent development and deployment of each layer while maintaining clear API boundaries.

## Phase 0: Research & Resolution

All technical decisions have been clarified based on user requirements:
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with modern hooks and components
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for REST API
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling multipart uploads
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library for thumbnail generation and optimization
- **Metadata Extraction**: ExifReader for extracting date/time from photo EXIF data
- **Storage Strategy**: Local file system with organized directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest for comprehensive coverage
- **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 drag and drop API with React integration

No further research required - all technical choices align with requirements and team expertise.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts (Complete)

### Generated Artifacts

- **data-model.md**: Complete entity definitions for Photo, DateGroup, and User entities with validation rules and relationships
- **contracts/api.yaml**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification for REST API with all endpoints documented
- **quickstart.md**: Comprehensive setup and usage guide for developers
- **Agent context updated**: GitHub Copilot instructions updated with current technology stack

### Key Design Decisions

1. **React + Node.js Stack**: Chosen for JavaScript consistency and rich ecosystem
2. **Local File Storage**: Organized directory structure with date-based organization
3. **JSON Data Storage**: Simple file-based storage with clear database migration path
4. **Sharp Image Processing**: High-performance thumbnail generation and optimization
5. **OpenAPI Specification**: Complete API contract for frontend-backend communication
