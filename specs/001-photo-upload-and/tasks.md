# Tasks: Photo Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-photo-upload-and/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution requirements (‚â•90% coverage). All tasks must include corresponding test tasks to ensure quality gates are met.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js structure
- **Frontend**: React application structure

- **Test Performance**: <5 minutes full test suite execution

### Constitutional Compliance Verification

- **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier enforced on every commit
- **Test Coverage**: ‚â•90% unit, ‚â•80% integration, ‚â•75% mutation testing
- **Performance**: Automated performance regression testing in CI/CD
