# Feature Specification: Photo Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-photo-upload-and`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "用户可以上传和整理照片，按日期分组，支持拖拽排序"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Photo Upload (Priority: P1)

Users can select and upload multiple photos from their device to the system. Photos are automatically organized by upload date and stored securely.

**Why this priority**: Photo upload is the foundational capability required for all other features. Without this, no other functionality is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading photos of various formats and sizes, verifying they appear in the system and are accessible for viewing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the main page, **When** they click "Upload Photos" and select multiple image files, **Then** all valid photos are uploaded and displayed
2. **Given** user selects a mix of supported (JPG, PNG) and unsupported file types, **When** upload is initiated, **Then** only supported files are uploaded and user is notified of any rejected files
3. **Given** user uploads photos taken on different dates, **When** upload completes, **Then** photos are automatically grouped by their creation date

### User Story 2 - Date-Based Organization (Priority: P2)

Users can view their photos organized automatically by date, with clear visual groupings showing photos from the same day, week, or month.

**Why this priority**: Automatic date organization provides immediate value and helps users locate photos quickly without manual effort.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading photos with different dates and verifying they appear in correct date groups with proper chronological ordering.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has photos from multiple dates, **When** they view their photo library, **Then** photos are grouped by date with clear section headers
2. **Given** user uploads new photos, **When** upload completes, **Then** photos automatically appear in the correct date group
3. **Given** user has many photos, **When** they scroll through date groups, **Then** performance remains smooth and responsive

---

### User Story 3 - Drag-and-Drop Sorting (Priority: P3)

Users can manually reorder photos within date groups by dragging them to new positions, allowing for custom organization beyond chronological order.

**Why this priority**: Manual sorting provides advanced organization capabilities for users who want more control over photo arrangement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by dragging photos to different positions within a date group and verifying the new order persists after page refresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing a date group with multiple photos, **When** they drag a photo to a new position, **Then** the photo moves to that position and other photos adjust accordingly
2. **Given** user has reordered photos, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the custom sort order is maintained
3. **Given** user drags a photo, **When** they hover over valid drop zones, **Then** visual feedback indicates where the photo will be placed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user uploads extremely large files (>100MB)?
- How does system handle corrupted or invalid image files?
- What occurs when user tries to upload duplicate photos?
- How does drag-and-drop behave on touch devices?
- What happens when photos lack date metadata?

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC)
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically extract date metadata from uploaded photos
- **FR-003**: System MUST group photos by creation date with fallback to upload date if metadata unavailable
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to upload multiple files simultaneously
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide upload progress indication for large files
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to drag photos to reorder them within date groups
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist custom sort orders across sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate file types and reject unsupported formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate thumbnail previews for efficient loading
- **FR-010**: System MUST limit maximum file size to 50MB per file
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent duplicate uploads of identical photos using file hash comparison
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide batch delete functionality allowing users to select and delete multiple photos within date groups

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Photo**: Digital image file with metadata including filename, size, format, creation date, upload date, custom sort position
- **DateGroup**: Collection of photos organized by date with display name and chronological ordering
- **User**: Entity that owns and manages photo collections

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can upload 10 photos in under 30 seconds on standard broadband connection
- **SC-002**: Photo thumbnails load within 2 seconds of viewing a date group
- **SC-003**: Drag-and-drop reordering responds within 100ms of user action
- **SC-004**: System successfully handles simultaneous upload of 50 photos without errors
- **SC-005**: 95% of supported image formats upload successfully on first attempt
- **SC-006**: Custom sort orders persist correctly after browser refresh in 100% of test cases

## Assumptions

- Users primarily want to organize photos by date rather than by custom categories
- Standard web browsers will be used (modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Users will typically upload photos in batches rather than individual files
- Touch device support is desired but not critical for initial release
- Photos will be stored securely but sharing functionality is not required initially
